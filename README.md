# GridMix - Smart Legal Energy Contract for Energy Trading

Gridmix is a starter project to get hackers familiar with the concepts of **transactive energy** and with a contract written in **solidity**. 

The solidity contract **gridmix.sol** is located in the **gridmix-sol** folder.

The **flow_diagrams** folder contains diagrams to help explain the concepts in the solidity file at a higher level.
